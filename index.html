        <p>My hobby is to play cricket. I love to play cricket .I play cricket everyday of the week either with my father or I go to my academy for coaching. I do play many other sports but cricket is my favourite one. Before this covid pandemic when we were allowed to go to school, I used to go for my cricket camp where me and my friends would play cricket matches.It was a lot of fun. I am an aggressive batsmen and bat well at 3. Because I play really well under pressure as captain my captaincy win percentage is 75%. I play cricket with my grandfather too. I love cricket.</p>

            <p>Virat Kohli is my favourite batsmen of all time.He is one of the best batsmen in the world. He is one of the highest run scorers in odi's.His odi average is 59.1 which is almost a 50 every game he plays.He has hit 43 centuries playing for India. He is also had the most wins as any captain in odi's.His batting style is defensive.</p>

            <p>Ab De Villiers is one of the biggest hitters of all time. He holds the record for the fastest ever ODI century which he made in just 30 balls. Since he hits so much you must have guessed by now his batting style is aggressive.His ipl average is 40.8 which is not really good but for an aggressive player it is one of the best averages.</p>
